This is a test application for the LDAPFilter* libraries.
You can run this as an applet in Netscape Navigator or Communicator,
or you can run this from a command-line by entering:

    java FilterTest2

To run the application, make sure that

    netscape.ldap.util.*

are in your classpath.  

The "Tag Pattern" is the string that you would use to select from the
set of filters (see the documentation on ldapfilter.conf).  And the
Value is the string that your user might potentially type in.

You can set the filter affixes by clicking on the "Modify Affixes" Button

Try starting out with "xax500" for the Tag Pattern and
"yourname@netscape.com" for the Value.  The text view at the bottom of
the window will show you what filters were matched.  The "FILTER"
string is what you get back from LDAPFilter.getFilter() and is usable
in LDAPConnection.search().

If you're looking for the bits of code that use the
LDAPFilterDescriptor, look for "LDAPFilter Example Code" in the
comments.  It is near all of the relevant code.
