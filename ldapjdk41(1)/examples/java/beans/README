                           LDAP Java bean examples
                           -----------------------

This directory contains some sample html pages which use the LDAP
Java beans included with the LDAP classes. These examples are designed
to work against the sample data contained in the Netscape Directory
Server distribution.  If you want to run these samples,
you will need to have a working LDAP server running, and the sample
"o=Airius.com" data from airius.ldif loaded.

Note that network security restrictions prevent these examples
from working correctly if they are accessed from a browser as local
files (i.e. "Open Page" and select the html file). To exercise them,
copy the contents of this directory to a directory published by a
Web server, and copy the subdirectories under "classes" under that
same published directory.
